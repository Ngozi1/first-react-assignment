 <!-- What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them -->

 a. In JSX, you must return a single parent or root element, in HTML you are free to do whatever you want as you do not have to return a single parent or root element.
 b. In JSX it is possible to write JavaScript directly, you can do this by putting the JavaScript in curly braces{} while in HTML you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript.
c. In JSX to define class names and for attributes, you do not do it as class or for, since both are reserved keywords in JavaScript. you actually create class components with the class keyword. so, to define class names in JSX, you do it as "className" and "HTMLFor"

<!-- Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?  -->

Browsers cannot read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engine to read and understand them.
